    "**Question 17.** In the textbook, we calculate the confidence interval of $p$ via norm approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(-\\epsilon < p - \\hat{p} < \\epsilon) \\approx P \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{n} \\epsilon}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}} < Z < \\frac{\\sqrt{n} \\epsilon}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}} \\right)$\n",

    "Another way is to replace $p$ simply with $\\hat{p} = S_n / n$ **(Type II)**. Now, letâ€™s compare these two types of confidence intervals.\n",

    "2. **Step 2**: Repeat Step 1 for $m = 1000$ times and check which type of $95\\%$ confidence interval will at least cover the true $p$ for more than $95\\%$ of times.\n",

    "From the above experiment, the Type I intervals always cover the true value, as compared to the intervals based on the estimate (Type II), which also have a high confidence level, albeit lower than Type I.
